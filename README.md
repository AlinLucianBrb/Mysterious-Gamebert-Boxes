## ⚡ About the Project
**Mysterious Gamebert Boxes** is a **2D platformer game** built in Unity, focused on **tight player movement**, **classic platforming mechanics**, and a **narrative-driven mission**.

You play as **Gamebert**, a legendary being born in the castle of the Game Kingdom.  
Chosen as king, Gamebert carries extraordinary power — the combined **knowledge of game development**, from programming and design to art and music, embedded deep within his genes.

As he grows, enemies emerge, seeking to steal this knowledge and dominate the gaming world.  
Their plan succeeds when Gamebert is lured into a realm of **mysterious loot boxes**, designed to distract and weaken him.

Now stranded in a dangerous world, Gamebert must:
- Navigate treacherous platforms  
- Overcome enemies trying to steal his power  
- Find the mysterious boxes  
- Reclaim his knowledge and save the kingdom  

This project blends **classic platformer gameplay** with a **light narrative framework**, serving both as a playable game and a learning-focused development project.
